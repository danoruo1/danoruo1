GameState.java
For use in the Final project for COSC 236.
Based on starter code first developed by Prof. Dastyni Loksa

This is the class to hold the state of the running game and allows easy
passing of important information to methods that require data from the
state of the game.

This starter code is designed for the verbs to be stored in the commandSystem.
